This project was developed as a gift for a friend who is photographer. I developed this portfolio utilizing the Laravel framework for back-end; and Bootstrap and AOS library for the front-end.

There is a database with an users table that saves the info of all the people who send a form. The form is a contact form; and once it is sent; the page owner receives an e-mail with the contact information and message.

At the back-end level, the routes are configured to change the views when clicking the elements of the menu; in addition, controllers and REST functions are called to perform their defined tasks: insert data to the database and send e-mails to the page owner.
